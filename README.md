Project #1 for Web Development Bootcamp

Class Roster Generator

This program allows a user to answer a list of questions and when submitted, complete a google form. 

That form data is then populated into a Google Spreadsheet and then displayed to the end-user as a Bootstrap card element. 

Here is a sample of the page on load and the animation that plays:
